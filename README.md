## Overview
    ### What we did
        Used some analysis on a dataset of weather from Hawaii.

## Results
    ###  What we found
        Precipitation and Temperature fluctuate through out the year, but seem to indicate that only a few points through out the year will there be enough precipitation to rain out the business.

        Temperatures however seem to remain relatively constant with the winter months likely requiring a wet suit to maintain warmth out on the water.

## Summary
    ### TLDR
        This analysis indicates that in the winter we could add rentals of wet suits to the lineup of offerings and possible make up for the few days of rainout that we will undoubtedly incur.

        If the data can be had, length of rainfall would be go to add into our analysis and possibly paint a better picture of the rainy days.  Do they go on for days, or do they pitter out at a couple hours.  Does temperature have a correlation to raing fall on any given day, If it's 50 degrees does that also mean it's more likely to be raining?  This analysis could go on for even more data types if they can become available.
